# SQS Daemon by AWS

## NodeJS workers in AWS EBS

### SQS Daemon by AWS

1. `nginx` sits between `sqsd` and workers for no good reason!
   * Its presence creates more issues:
     * `5xx` errors that claim "loss of connection to upstream server"
     * connection errors like `ECONNRESET` and various other socket hangup problems
2. `sqsd` itself is quite buggy too
   * messages end up on dead letter queue \(`DLQ`\) despite the worker reporting `200 OK` for success.
