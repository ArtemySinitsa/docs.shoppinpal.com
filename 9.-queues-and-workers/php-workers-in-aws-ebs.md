# PHP workers in AWS EBS

## PHP

![](../.gitbook/assets/worker-architecture.png)

1. `messages` are sent to SQS.
2. A static amount \(configurable\) of PHP `workers` are kept alive by the `Supervisor`.
   * Given the nature of PHP, we optimize `workers` to stop and restart every X minutes.
3. While workers are running, they attempt to fetch messages from SQS.
   * If a `worker` gets a `message` then it starts working on that job and takes it to completion.
   * If a `worker` crashes while processing then the `Supervisor` will bring it back up.
     * What will happen to the message that was pulled off the queue by that "crashed" `worker`?
     * Will the resurrected worker start work on the same exact `message` again?
