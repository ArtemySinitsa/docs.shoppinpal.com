# Learning Git

## Basics

1. Start your training with the free course: [Try Git](https://try.github.io)
1. It is important to understand the process in [this](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) article.
    * Memorizing the commands is not important because those are part of the UI in tools like [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) as clickable buttons.
1. Watch this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11gkl1nfHHU1UQnd1n6Z4IaWeKA8PniqMf3TRTbgwe6c/present?slide=id.p4 "Open in new window") on `Git Flow` by [Aquid](https://github.com/aquid) [test2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11gkl1nfHHU1UQnd1n6Z4IaWeKA8PniqMf3TRTbgwe6c/edit)
1. Then move on to intermediate courses which require a paid subscription. There is a very good chance that your company already pays for it or could start paying for it. So quickly check with your reporting manager to make use of what's available.
