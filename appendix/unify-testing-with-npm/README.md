Even docker mixes npm scripts with docker and mocha tests very well: [https://engineering.gosquared.com/testing-with-docker](https://engineering.gosquared.com/testing-with-docker)

Some people prefer to use `grunt` commands to make it easy, like: `grunt test:e2e` can be setup and configured to take care of running all tests without knowing much about underlying stuff. But it would be nicer if same could be [accomplished via the scripts](http://www.kramnameloc.com/getting-started-with-protractor) in `package.json` instead.
