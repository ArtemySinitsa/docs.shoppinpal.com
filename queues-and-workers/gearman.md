# Gearman

### What is Gearman?

### Can I find or create a dockerized environment to play with gearman?

You can use github code search to find something suitable or collect clues on how to create your own. For example, here are some curated results from a search on - [gearman filename:docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=gearman+filename%3Adocker-compose.yml&type=Code):

* A [repo](https://github.com/EvaEngine/Dockerfiles) with lots of votes
* A [repo](https://github.com/thinkspill/weather-api) that might use gearman with a real world usecase: `Weather API proxy deployed as a set of docker containers.` Therefore it may be good for learning about how to use gearman.
* A [repo](https://github.com/cbrews/qstate) that might use gearman with a real world usecase: `A multi-container state queue as a service web API.` Therefore it may be good for learning about how to use gearman.
* A [repo](https://github.com/z7zmey/docker) that has gearman and the words `cli-consumer-php` which seems somewhat interesting to explore because our team has previously built CLI based PHP workers for AWS EBS.
* A [repo](https://github.com/dsaouda/docker-gearman) which has scripting instructions in [`docker-entrypoint.sh`](https://github.com/dsaouda/docker-gearman/blob/master/docker-entrypoint.sh) which seem quite important for setting up gearman in a much more robust fashion than anyone else has before.
