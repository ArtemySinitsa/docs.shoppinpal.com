# Roles in Loopback
Loopback allows you to define various [User Roles](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Defining-and-using-roles.html) based on the requirements. It enables you to define both [static](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Defining-and-using-roles.html#static-roles) and [dynamic](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Defining-and-using-roles.html#dynamic-roles) roles. Static roles are stored in a data source and are mapped to users. In contrast, dynamic roles arenâ€™t assigned to users and are determined during access.


### Multi-Tenant Roles 
1. An `orgAdmin` like role is required for access over REST to allow for administrative actions needed for any particular organization:
    1. API's to manage/invite other users,
    2. profile and payments configurations, and
    3. deciding hierarchal powers.
    4. Hopefully, it makes sense naturally that such actions *should* only be allowed for an organization's administrators.
2. An `orgUser` role is required for accessing other basic APIs which help an organization execute properly.

### Built-In Roles
LoopBack enables you to define dynamic roles that are defined at run-time. 

LoopBack provides the following built-in dynamic roles:
- `$owner` - Owner of the object
- `$authenticated` - authenticated user
- `$unauthenticated` - Unauthenticated user
- `$everyone` - Everyone

### Define a Custom Role
You can create custom roles through boot scripts.

Here's an example of creating a custom role:

```
var Role = app.models.Role;
var RoleMapping = app.models.RoleMapping;

Promise.resolve()
.then(function () {
    return Role.findOrCreate(
        {where: {name: 'orgAdmin'}}, // find
        {
            name: 'orgAdmin',
            description: 'admin of the org'
        } // or, create
    );
})
.then(function () {
    log.trace('Role created successfully');
    return cb();
})
.catch(function (error) {
    log.error('Error in creating roles', error);
    return cb(error);
});
```
