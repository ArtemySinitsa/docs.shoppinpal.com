# Better search with NGram

## Better Search? What does it mean, better how?

Let's say a user wants to search for: `gift ideas` in their notes but they accidently type `gist ideas`. One of the notes which should match as a search result has the title which contains `super cool gifts list` ... what now?

It means the search engine needs to be configured further and one way to do that is by using `nGram`.

1. A well configured `nGram`, would break the word `gifts` from the original title, down into various combinations such as:
```
gi | if | ft
gif | ift
gift
```
and store it for matching when a search occurs.

2. So even if users accidently used the word `gist` when searching, their query would be broken down into:
```
gi | is | st
gis | ist
gist
```
and at least a partial match would exist between the many broken down tokens: `gi` - 1 out of 6 tokens matched.
    * This will allow for the note titled `super cool gifts list` to show up as a search result.
    * It will be A low ranked search result but it is better than missing it completely.
    * There are other meaningful improvements like an auto-suggester which states: `showing search results for "gist ideas" ... did you mean "gift ideas"?` but that is a different topic entirely.

3. The same concept for using `ngrams` applies to full-text search (FTE) anywhere: websites, blogs, eCommerce or personal notes.

## Configuring NGram

NGram vs. Edge NGram â€” The NGram token filter generates all n-grams of the configured sizes for each token. For example, with the default settings (`min_gram=1` and `max_gram=2`), "brown" is tokenized into:

`[b] [r] [o] [w] [n] [br] [ro] [ow] [wn]`

The Edge NGram token filter only generates n-grams from the beginning of the word:

`[b] [br]`

If you use edge n-grams, you will probably want to increase `max_gram` so you generate a few more terms. Setting it to 5 would yield:

`[b] [br] [bro] [brow] [brown]`

Thanks to `ngrams`, Well tuned queries can be matched directly:

```
Query: j
Analyzed Query Terms: [j]
Document Terms: [ju] [um] [mp] [jum] [ump] [jump]
 
Query: ju
Analyzed Query Terms: <ju>
Document Terms: <ju> [um] [mp] [jum] [ump] [jump]
 
Query: jum
Analyzed Query Terms: <jum>
Document Terms: [ju] [um] [mp] <jum> [ump] [jump]
 
Query: jump
Analyzed Query Terms: <jump>
Document Terms: [ju] [um] [mp] [jum] [ump] <jump>
```
