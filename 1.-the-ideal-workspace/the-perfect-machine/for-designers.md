## For Designers

1. Always use a solid state drive - SSD.
   * Lack of space should be supplemented with a low cost [ultra fit usb flash drive](http://a.co/b827zXr).
2. High CPU - need large amounts of processing power for dealing with numerous layers in tools like photoshop
3. High Memory
4. We recommend [Apple 13 inch macbook pro](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro)
   * 2.9GHz CPU
   * 16GB Memory \(requires a customized model\)
   * 256GB SSD
   * roughly **2,000 USD**
