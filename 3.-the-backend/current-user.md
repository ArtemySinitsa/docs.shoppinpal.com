# Current User

One of the ways that developers can _do more_ with loopback is by adding their own [remote methods](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/Remote+methods).

But sometimes its super important for those remote methods to operate in context of the currently logged-in user. And this section will cover how to set that up.
