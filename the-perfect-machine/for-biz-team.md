# The Perfect Machine

## For Biz Team

1. Always use a solid state drive - SSD.
    * Lack of space should be supplemented with a low cost [ultra fit usb flash drive](http://a.co/b827zXr).
2. CPU and memory should be sufficient to allow for the use of following applications in parallel:
    1. VOIP (voice over IP) with screen sharing and/or and screen recording. For ex: skype, hipchat, zoom.us, google hangouts, webex, slack, joinme etc.
    2. Browsers with multiple tabs and/or sessions
4. We recommend [Apple 13 inch macbook air](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air)
    * 1.6GHz CPU
    * 8GB Memory
    * 128GB SSD
    * roughly **1,000 USD**
