# The Perfect Machine

## For Developers

1. Always use a solid state drive - SSD.
    * Lack of space should be supplemented with a low cost [ultra fit usb flash drive](http://a.co/b827zXr).
2. CPU and memory should be sufficient to allow for the use of following applications in parallel:
    1. VOIP (voice over IP) with screen sharing and/or and screen recording. For ex: skype, hipchat, zoom.us, google hangouts, webex, slack, joinme etc.
    2. Browsers with multiple tabs and/or sessions
    3. Terminal or CMD prompt
    4. IDE
3. Specifications should actively **discourage** the use of functionality which is better off on a [cloud-box](../setup-a-machine-in-the-cloud.html). Using a cloud-box sets a better precedent for how your developers perceive the deployment cycle from _start to finish_. This devops-first approach works in the best interest of a developer's skillset and the company's bottom line.
4. We recommend [Apple 13 inch macbook air](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air)
    * 1.6GHz CPU
    * 8GB Memory
    * 256GB SSD
    * This still might be just a tad too powerful!
    * Even with these models, we haven't been able to get some of our developers to see the light: "Always build and run in docker with the cloud-box."
