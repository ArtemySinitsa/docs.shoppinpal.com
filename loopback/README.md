## Moving from Java to JavaScript
Do you have a strong background in Java? Here is a mapping that will help you gain a quick understanding of what's what in our stack:

| Java | equivalent tech in NodeJS | We Use |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Ant, Maven | Grunt, Gulp | Grunt |
| SpringBoot | ExpressJS, Loopback | Loopback |
| JPA Library | sequelize, loopback-juggler | loopback-juggler |

## Loopback

Just like the industry moved from `web servers` to `application servers`. It is now moving from `application servers` to `api servers` as a matter of convenience and to facilitate faster development cycles.

Loopback is built on top of ExpressJS. It is then next logical step for those who want to write REST~ful services.

We will cover `loopback` in this chapter.
